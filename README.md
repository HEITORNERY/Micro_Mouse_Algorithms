# Micro_Mouse_Algorithms
We used the mackorone micromouse simulator to test the algorithms. You can clone this repository and now have access to the simulator along with the codes to solve the maze, just use the command below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HEITORNERY/Micro_Mouse_Algorithms.git
```
Or you can clone the mackorone repository directly from here (https://github.com/mackorone/mms?tab=readme-ov-file) and get more information on how to use the simulator provided there.
### Depth First Search Algorithm
The Depth First Search algorithm is an algorithm, which aims to explore the entire maze, find the target position, return to the beginning and return via the fastest path to the target position. 
One2Remember has made available a code that uses this logic to solve the micromouse maze in the simulator, which will be the logic of the code present in this repository. Here (https://github.com/One2Remember/Micromouse) you can access the One2Remember repository and understand the construction of the algorithm. Reinforcing our thanks to One2Remember for making this incredible algorithm available.    
The code that must be executed in the simulator with the Depth First Search logic is DFS.py.
