# Micro_Mouse_Algorithms
We used the mackorone micromouse simulator to test the algorithms. You can clone this repository and now have access to the simulator along with the codes to solve the maze, just use the command below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HEITORNERY/Micro_Mouse_Algorithms.git
```
Or you can clone the mackorone repository directly from here (https://github.com/mackorone/mms?tab=readme-ov-file) and get more information on how to use the simulator provided there.
### Breadth-First Search Algorithm (BFS)
The BFS algorithm is used to go through each level looking for the shortest path to the destination. One2Remember has made available a code that implement the search in breadth to solve the micromouse maze in the simulator. 
Here (https://github.com/One2Remember/Micromouse) you can access the One2Remember repository and understand the construction of the algorithm. Reinforcing our thanks to One2Remember for making this incredible algorithm available.    
The code that must be executed in the simulator with this logic is BFS.py.
### Depth-First Search Algorithm (DFS)
The DFS algorithm performs a deep search throughout the maze and therefore its execution may take longer than the execution of the previous algorithm that combines the mapping power of DFS with the agility to find the fastest path that BFS does. However, it's still great code for mapping, so it shouldn't be overlooked. The DFS code is DFS.py. Run it to see its resolution.
