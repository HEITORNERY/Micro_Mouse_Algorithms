# Micro_Mouse_Algorithms
We used the mackorone micromouse simulator to test the algorithms. You can clone this repository and now have access to the simulator along with the codes to solve the maze, just use the command below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HEITORNERY/Micro_Mouse_Algorithms.git
```
Or you can clone the mackorone repository directly from here (https://github.com/mackorone/mms?tab=readme-ov-file) and get more information on how to use the simulator provided there.
